Linux kernel
============

There are several guides for kernel developers and users. These guides can
be rendered in a number of formats, like HTML and PDF. Please read
Documentation/admin-guide/README.rst first.

In order to build the documentation, use ``make htmldocs`` or
``make pdfdocs``.  The formatted documentation can also be read online at:

    https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/

There are various text files in the Documentation/ subdirectory,
several of them using the Restructured Text markup notation.

Please read the Documentation/process/changes.rst file, as it contains the
requirements for building and running the kernel, and information about
the problems which may result by upgrading your kernel.

- This is a modified version of kernel for sfork implementation
- The repo containing the library of sfork is [this](https://github.com/Chinmaygoyal/CS730-Project_RPC)
- In order to install the kernel first do:

```bash
make menuconfig
```

- After this `kernel-install.sh` file can be executed. This script uses 8 threads to execute the make commands.
- Boot the newly installed kernel to use sfork command.
